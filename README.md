# MLEnd-Hums-and-Whistles-Miniproject
The mini-project consists of two components:  
## Basic solution [6 marks]: 
Using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a Potter or a StarWars audio segment and predicts its song label (either Harry or StarWars). 
## Advanced solution [10 marks]:
There are two options. (i) Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model. (ii) Create a product that uses the functionality provided by a model trained on the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset (e.g. a simple App that predicts the label Harry or StarWars when you hum to it).
